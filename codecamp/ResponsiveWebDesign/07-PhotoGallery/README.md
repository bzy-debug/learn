# What I learn from this project

- make an element a flex by assigning attribute `display` the value `flex` (this can be done in `css`)

- properties about `flex`:
    - `flex-direction`
    - `flex-wrap`
    - `justify-content`: the position along the axis
    - `align-item`: the position along the cross axis

- The `::after` pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. 
  css can create element
